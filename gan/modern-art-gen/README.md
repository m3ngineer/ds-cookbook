# Creating art through using generative adversarial networks

General adversarial networks consist of two convolutional neural networks (CCNs): a generator and a discriminator. The generator create new data based on a training set, while the disciminator attempts to differentiate between the training and data that the generator made.

The generator and discriminator have an adversarial and productive relationship whereby both try to outsmart the other.

## About the data
The data used for this project is from [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org), a non-profit collaboration that aims to make art accessible to anyone and everywhere. The organization has made over 100,000 paintings sorted by different styles and artists. A dataset of artworks by genre can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/wikiart-gangogh-creating-art-gan).
